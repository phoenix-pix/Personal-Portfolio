Personal Portfolio

I wanted to completely overhaul my original design and create something completely different with far more features and interactivity baked into it. 

Website developed using SCSS, HTML & vanilla JS with no dependecies. 

Brief Summary Overview

-Dark/light mode toggle 
-Custom animation and styling effects for interactive elements 
-Fully responsive design 
-PHP contact form with spam protection via Hcaptcha
